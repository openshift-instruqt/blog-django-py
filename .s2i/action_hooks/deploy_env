# This is a 'deploy_env' action hook. This script will be executed
# inline to the custom 'run' script as well as for any interactive shell
# if so enabled. As it is executed inline, it doesn't need to start with
# a '#!' line nor be marked as an executable file. This script will be
# interpreted as if it is a 'bash' script. This script allows a user to
# dynamically set additional environment variables required by the
# deploy process. These might for example be environment variables which
# tell an application where files it requires are located. When we
# source the 'deploy_env' script, any environment variables set by it
# will be automatically exported. Although principally intended for
# setting environment variables, it can include other script logic, but
# this should be avoided except to the extent it is required to work
# out what to set any environment variables to.
